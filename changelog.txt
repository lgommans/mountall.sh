Version 1.4 2020-02-05
- Fix mounting from another directory. You can now:
    $ cd /tmp && mountall.sh ~/sdcard.img
  Previously this would try to create "/tmp/mnt-~/sdcard.img1",
  now it will use "/tmp/mnt-sdcard.img1".

- Improve error message when mounting failed


Version 1.3 2016-08-02

- Added usage text and some info when it's called with no arguments.

- Changed 'mount -o=ro' to 'mount -o ro'. This was a staged change for months
and I honestly forgot why this was. Reading the 'mount' man page, it seems
the change is correct, at least for my system, so let's keep the change.


Version 1.2
Fixed bug where it would miss the first partition. Might be caused by a
different fdisk version or disk type.
Instead of taking line 10+ it now greps for the partition table header (the
line containing 'Device Boot Start' etc.) and takes all lines below that.


Version 1.0 2015-10
Initial working version
